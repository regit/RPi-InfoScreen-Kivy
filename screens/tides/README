A plugin has the following structure

/FolderName (Must be unique)
 |--> conf.json
 |--> screen.py
 |--> NAME.kv

1) FolderName

Must be unique as this is the identifier used by the master script to handle the different screens.

2) conf.json

JSON formatted file. Has two mandatory parameters:
   "screen" - the class name of the main screen for the plugin.
   "kv" - the name of the kv file (including extension) which contains the layout for your plugin.

Optional parameters:
   "enabled" - plugins can be disabled by setting this to false.
   "params" - any specific parameters to be passed to your plugin
   "dependencies" - list any non-standard libraries that are needed to run your plugin. If these aren't installed then the user will be notified.

3) screen.py

The class must inherit the Kivy Screen class.
